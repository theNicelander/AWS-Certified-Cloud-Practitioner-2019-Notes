# Module 1 - Introduction
> **Outcome**: Define what AWS is and the basic infrastructure

**Cloud computing**: Refers to the on-demand delivery of it resources and applications via the internet without having to invest in hardware. Automatically scale computing to meet our needs
* Reduce risk by quickly and elastically to changing market, quickly test and throwaway
* Scalability: Use services at your  own risk
* Designed for scalability, durability
* Experiment quicker, more often and with less cost

Reasons why companies are moving to the cloud:
* Increase speed
* Ease of experimentation
* Cultivating culture of innovation

Why? Putting data centres close to your global customers is costly. With AWS you can do that at a click of a button.
* Can spin up servers for a moment, then shut them down when you are done

Elasticity is the ability to scale computing up and down easily
* Quickly deploy new apps
* Instantly scale up as work grows
* Instantly shut down when something isn't needed
* **Auto scaling** & **Elastic Load Balancing**

Reliability: Ability of a system to recover from failures. In cloud, it means to be able to acquire computing to meet demand and mitigate disruption.
* AWS does this with Regions and Availability Zones

## AWS interfaces
3 ways to access AWS resources, that all reference the AWS API
* Management Console
  * GUI online or in a mobile app
  * Can create shortcuts using the pin icon
  * Can create resource groups
  * Can create tags for resources that support tags
  * Helpful learning resources
  * Build a solution wizard helps to build new apps
* CLI (command line interface)
  * Command line, programming language agnostic
  * Open source tool - Linux, MacOS, unix, windows
* SDKs (software development kits)
  * Use in existing apps
  * Create apps that use AWS
  * Javascript, java, python, php, .net, ruby, go, node.js, c++
